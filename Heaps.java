Heaps are binary trees in which insertion happens at end node, then it is compared to parent node to check condition for min heap or max heap.
In min heap, parent is always lesser than child and vice versa
Deletion in heap happens at root level, then swapping and comparision starts
Heaps only provide insertion/deletion at max or min element
